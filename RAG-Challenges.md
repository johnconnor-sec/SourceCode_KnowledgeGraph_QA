# RAG-Challenges

1. Improve Query Understanding:
   
   As discussed in the [Metaphor Systems example](https://medium.com/barnacle-labs/training-a-large-language-model-on-your-content-f366ae50305b), I can use a query understanding system to rewrite and optimize user queries. For a question like "What does this program do?", I could rewrite it to something more specific like "Provide an overview of the main functions and purpose of the codebase in the current context."

   ```python
   class CodebaseQuery(BaseModel):
       rewritten_query: str
       relevant_file_types: List[str]
       search_depth: int

   query = client.chat.completions.create(
       model="gpt-4",
       response_model=CodebaseQuery,
       messages=[
           {"role": "system", "content": "You're a query understanding system for a codebase search engine."},
           {"role": "user", "content": "What does this program do?"},
       ],
   )
   ```

2. Enhance Semantic Search:
   
   Improve my vector search implementation to better match generic queries with relevant code snippets. This might involve:
   - Creating more granular embeddings of my codebase
   - Using a combination of keyword and semantic search
   - Implementing a fallback mechanism when semantic search fails

3. Provide More Context:
   
   When a generic question is asked, provide the LLM with a broader context about the codebase. This could include:
   - A high-level overview of the project structure
   - README files or documentation
   - Key file names and their purposes

4. Implement a Conversation Flow:
   
   As mentioned in the [Nebuly blog post](https://www.nebuly.com/blog/what-is-user-analytics-for-llms), understanding the flow of a conversation can be crucial. If a user asks a generic question, my system could:
   - Ask for clarification
   - Provide a list of possible topics the user might be interested in
   - Give a broad overview and then ask if the user wants to dive deeper into any specific area

5. Use Chain-of-Thought Prompting:
   
   Encourage the LLM to think through the problem step-by-step. For example:

   ```python
   prompt_template = """
   You are an AI assistant tasked with analyzing a codebase. Follow these steps:
   1. Identify the main entry point of the program
   2. List the key functions or classes
   3. Describe the overall purpose of the code
   4. Mention any notable libraries or frameworks used

   Based on the provided code snippets, answer the following question:
   {question}

   If you're unsure about any part, state what you know and what you're uncertain about.
   """
   ```

6. Implement User Analytics:
   
   As suggested in the Nebuly blog post, implementing user analytics can help me understand common user intents and frustrations. This data can be used to improve my system over time, making it better at handling generic queries.

7. Use a Combination of Retrieval Methods:
   
   Don't rely solely on vector search. Implement a combination of:
   - Keyword search
   - Semantic search
   - Code structure analysis (e.g., looking at function names, class hierarchies)
   - Documentation retrieval

By implementing these strategies, I should be able to provide more meaningful responses to generic questions about my codebase. Remember, the key is to give the LLM enough context and guidance to formulate a helpful response, even when the initial query is vague.
